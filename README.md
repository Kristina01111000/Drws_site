speed test:

https://web.dev/measure/:

Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't

See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

On patreon make the holistic learning program link hot in the pinned post
write an email for new users of the patreon to get that talks about the community
look at the emails to see what needs to change, link to patreon, and growing holistically
Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month

12/7

- On the quiz page emphasize joining growingholistically in the big box

- make sure he understands quickstart, how it doesn't save lgoins, + isn't that great, thats why i never brought is up before, it exists, but its propbably better to just keep them seperate



- Can google analytics work for patreon pages, add it if it does work


12/28
- Look into more ways to market the patreon
- For the app:
	- Make a slide
	- After dr w on homepage
	- put page under programs tab in header
	- Is the app only for people who pay? Probably only for those who join at $5 a month or more 

- For fourelementinstitute and syracuse natural healing the security plugin caused a lockout again, look into getting a new one

check on the quiz page

1/11
- Add the 40qq page back to the homepage, and to the header, and the menu
- connect the get out app page to the rest of the site
- make a slide for the app with a link to the app page


For next week:
See if PMP can show the start date of the users if they aren’t paying
make chats for all of the quizzes 6 - 9, also write leading questions for discussion

- the header and footer images need to be fixed so they don't look bad when they're small
- add titles of lessons to the course chats 
- Change the chat titles to share your thoughts on lesson __

- asked my mom to try the quiz to see if it makes any sense
- he wants people on GH automatically after joining the patreon

2/22

For next week:
Make chats for the quizzes that don’t have them

When people join the patreon: their email gets added to constant contact and we will manually make them an account on GH
He is going to send me some text for the quiz page bottom boxes, and quiz page intro paragraph 
See if i can add a box to the pdf page so that last paragraph stands our better


Things to do when quizzes (40Q & 80Q) are back:


pdf
40Q
80Q
Check that the paragraphs on the pdf all make sense
80Q  fourth
work on the box at the bottom of pdf
40Q
80Q
fix up the quiz page
delete name capture box 
Change coupon box in bottom and add something in that box, 
40Q
80Q
For the links to the quiz, assessment feels way too formal, quiz might be too informal, but it seems more doable than assessment, are there other options for the word to call them?  Self-assessment might work, maybe Self-assessment Quiz, self assessment survey, self-evaluation  see what looks best
Only put the 40Q on the site, the 80Q is for a few months from now
Add the 40qq page back to the homepage, and to the header, and the menu (top of second sidebar) Take our 4 element self evaluation



2/29

fix the colors of the quiz matrix questions
Check the constant contact box ->  see if peepso update fixed it
Put the wellness self check where?
See if i can round the corners in the wellness self check
Add the logo to the wellness self check 
Change the margins to get it on one page
Make the boxes tickable
Say something about saving it so they can compare

For quizzes change the hotlink to say “Check out our patreon for more”

Make the paragraph a few paragraphs with the site link hot in the middle
