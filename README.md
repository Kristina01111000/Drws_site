- real simple ssl 
- Forget About Shortcode button

Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now

See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

scorecard link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507

- he wants 10 questions per quiz if possible:
	- Quizzes that have 10 questions: # 1,
	- Quizzes than need 10 questions: # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5,
	- Quizzes than need a lesson to be dropped first: # 6, and up 

- google doc for emails:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc_WVsgZKdhpWaHZyDn81rw4y02Dlj2wB-O-q9ZnJXs/edit?usp=sharing

to do now:

- Write a review in fourissimo club for the heel strike fixing plantar fasciitis
- 
Things im waiting for from dr w:
- email  list for current clients, hopefully soon
- more lesson videos


In future:

- Send emails at 10 am on monday for newsletter
- think of how to switch emails to be about the app, it should be ready sometime soon hopefully, he doesn't have the code yet, just the video
- give people the option between the app and the scorecard site? -> have a line like "download our scorecard app here or get a copy of the scorecard here" -> on both the site and in the emails

5/4

- add titles of lessons to the course chats 
-Change the chat titles to share your thoughts on lesson __

- The scorecard inspired me to _____ and _____
- Like somebody doing the scorecard and leaving little comments

Great outdoors group

- the weather was so nice today, it made my time gardening better
- something about ideas for what to do outside other than swimming when it it really hot
- then an answer can be go for walks/ bike rides in the early morning, or after sunset when it is cooled, go for hikes in shaded areas
- ideas for outside activities when the weather is bad, like cold and damp

Nutrition group

- share a recipe? Not against the idea of outside recipes ie quinoa salad recipe


- Skeinific is definitely a person, make sure she is confirmed

How does facebook, twitter, youtube, instagram, tiktok, the site, patreon connect to each other
He is thinking of giving current patients a free appointment if they join the patreon, figure out how to word that in a good way -> he will figure that out

see if the wordpress update changed the constnat contact problem

do the book edit
Add an email list only sign up
Learning program will not be free anymore, only the first lesson, need to make lots of little changes to the site
30 day challenge is still free
Keep stuff on the patreon, but have links to it
how to organize the videos on patreon also?
fix the form so people get added to constnat contact -> talk to peepso support

Ask if he still wants quizzes on the site -> i think so 

see if i can connect the constnat contact form to the pepso form, they sit on top of each other now, they can only do one at a time -> contacted peepso support, currently the sign up for email doesn't go through



8/24
In info section of book, ad you can get the book as a reward if you join the patreon 
Have a link that says “not sure you are ready to join? Try our free 30 day challenge”
Add the email list to the are you sure page, to get the scorecard


8/30
Look at the quick minutes and see how they are, see if he should look at any of them
On patreon make the holistic learning program link hot in the pinned post
Maybe make a start here collection for the documentary and the phone app explanation, think of other ways of approaching it
Link from the patreon posts to the quizzes on gh
Enable quizzes only to patrons somehow
fix the lessons so they link to the patreon site post, so the video isn’t on gh
We might redo the entire first page, which is better pushing 30 day challenge or the patreon
Site should be focused on getting people to patreon and focusing on the community part of it, think about what parts of the site to get rid of
Get rid of the holistic growth tab, put activity page at the top
Figure out a way to make the metadata tags on patreon link to the site
New page: Have a section of dr w’s patreon collections, use a drop down or url with blurb about the collection and a link to the patreon site put on header where holistic growth is currently
Make the site look like a nice social media site
Have a start here patreon collection that includes the documentary, the gh site, and the scorecard
write an email for new users of the patreon to get that talks about the community
Think about whether or not he needs a newsletter, it should have links to posts for the past few weeks, 
look at the emails to see what needs to change, link to patreon, and growing holistically
Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month




for 9/7:
he is still thinking of using audio files, keep telling him that they can only be sent in gmail
how big is the overhaul of the site going to be, does he still want the color scheme to stay the same?
look at t he new temp homepage, what should be moved it it?


Did you decide if you still wanted a slider talking about the things available on the homepage?

Right now my understanding of the homepage is that you want it changed so it is more of a sale page for the patreon and the actual website will be a  community for current patreon members. Is this correct?

Should all mentions of the 30 day challenge be removed entirely? 
Or should it be mentioned but most of the page is trying to get people to join the patreon?
make sure to read everything for slang that he doesn't know he is using



9/7:

Pick a quick minute sample to be embedded on the homepage
Pick a video to put on the homepage, optimally one of him talking about the patreon site
For bullet point about learning program link to the first lesson on the site, then sell the patreon underneath it
For bullet point quick minutes say they are available for free and join the patreon to see them
Think about how the 30 day challenge should be used going forward, where should we talk about it etc, in a collection ‘things you can do now working title’ phone apps and more, something like that, talk about it in the newsletter
For homepage add more hotlinks below the slider, if you are already a member click here to get to our patreon site collections


look at the picture in email from the patreon, is there a place it will look good in the site? not the homepage


found where to edit the lorem ipsum.  its in the javascript file, made edits, need access to c panel to put the file on the site, got access go over that i can edit the other text tomorrow if i'm careful

go over the quick minute videos, try to get 15 done by thursday, there are 24 on youtube, don't know how many on patreon
videos done: 9

figure out why siteground security was causing issues with login or find a new security plugin for both sites


work on spreadsheet for videos
