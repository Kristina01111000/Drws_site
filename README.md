Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
		- yellow image for philosophers corner
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- yearly scorecard link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IxK22ihszAVXQgxLD9di-MhoP3kERT8SlfXiGddOmhc/edit
	- Monthly topics will be articles now, not a class
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now


Survey stuff:

	list of survey options/questions:
		- he wants all of the 80 questions in list
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
		- wpforms pro does not work
		- hubspot for wordpress does not work
		- quiz and survey master does not work
		- tryuquiz does not work
		- he is taking care of the quiz 
	
See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

- https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/automated-welcome-series/ 15 emails every 2 days, look at core vs plus
- We will email them every other day with a link to a quick minute on youtube

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507

- See how to see all member data from peepso at one time -> is it even possible? -> look under users, or under manage -> nope, can look at learn dash stuff though

- he wants 10 questions per quiz if possible:
	- Quizzes that have 10 questions: # 1,
	- Quizzes than need 10 questions: # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5,
	- Quizzes than need a lesson to be dropped first: # 6, and up

to do now:

- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people

- Fix the title of the download pdf on fourissimo page
- For groups get new pictures, add a scorecard picture for scorecard group
- For google doc see if ‘make a copy’ can be put up when they try to request access
- Look into file upload plugin for fourissimo page -> new plugin from peepso
- rethink the welcome email that gets sent when they sign up for the site, add links?
- Come up with a prompt for the chat page for all lessons, not too long
- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
- Make a list of the people who aren’t verified, see if peepso will do it automatically

- plan is to send out emails starting on week of feb 2nd?
- add a page for reviews, just dont link to it anywhere

- he is going to write a different description - he sent it, look at it to see if it is good
- List his book on the front page, add a buy dr w’s book here section on front page
- make another page for just the book listing above the  documentary on the menu

- What  sample chapter should we add to the book listing? Probably chapter 1? Should I take the same excerpt from 4e lifestyle? https://4elementlifestyle.com/dr-ws-book/ introduction, part of chapter one, also include the table of contents, make sure some of the pictures are in the sample, up to page 15 
new description for the book listing? The current one is the one from 4e lifestyle, take it from the back cover of the book

- set up a new potential email, forward it to him

- New image should have a smiley faced person, or people, with a teacup, walking in the woods, or doing yoga, something like that look on bigstock
- Maybe don’t say the days of the challenge, think about that, so that we don’t make people who haven't started it don't feel bad but also sounds good to people who have started it
- Maybe putting some info in to make it more like a newsletter, something about eating healthy -> newsletter is seperate
- Look and see if the email can be wider in desktop
