Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- yearly

	- Monthly topics will be articles now, not a class
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now


Survey stuff:

	list of survey options/questions:
		- he wants all of the 80 questions in list
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
		- wpforms pro does not work
		- hubspot for wordpress does not work
		- quiz and survey master does not work
		- tryuquiz does not work
		- he is taking care of the quiz 
	
See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

scorecard link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507

- he wants 10 questions per quiz if possible:
	- Quizzes that have 10 questions: # 1,
	- Quizzes than need 10 questions: # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5,
	- Quizzes than need a lesson to be dropped first: # 6, and up 

- Ccholistic1! For constant contact hwalsdorf

- google doc for emails:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc_WVsgZKdhpWaHZyDn81rw4y02Dlj2wB-O-q9ZnJXs/edit?usp=sharing

to do now:

- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
- Write a review in fourissimo club for the heel strike fixing plantar fasciitis
- Fix the title of the download pdf on fourissimo page
- Look into file upload plugin for fourissimo page -> new plugin from peepso


- add a page for reviews, just dont link to it anywhere
- check names of lessons on promo page when new youtube video is dropped

Things im waiting for from dr w:
- email  list for current clients, hopefully soon
- new video explaining the 30 day challenge - probably not until summer
- more lesson videos

TO do:


- Make logo of the youtube channel green part bigger add white background 

Plan is to include 30 day challenge on the first 4 news letters, then not on the others, b/c everyone who signs up for the first 30 days will definitely be doing it/ not be done with it

emails done: current patients and first 4
Send newsletters on monday at 10 am

For email google doc:
- list of quotes
- list of tips
- list of videos
- check them off when they are used so we don't have repeats






In future:

- Send emails at 10 am on monday for newsletter
- think of how to switch emails to be about the app, it should be ready sometime soon hopefully, he doesn't have the code yet, just the video
- give people the option between the app and the scorecard site? -> have a line like "download our scorecard app here or get a copy of the scorecard here" -> on both the site and in the emails
- he is going to send me a copy of the app to look at, its still being made, problem with the developer



5/4
- Add some comments in every group so they have people to talk to / do't feel wierd as the first commenter
- 	use krist acct, see if i can change the name
- 	use w's account also, cna just have some comments responding to other comments
- See if we can move people to a different campaign in constant contact, easily based on when they joined, like 2 weeks then move them to a different campaigns
- Reconsider the groups, are they good, should we get rid of some, add some? added to to do list
- Make a new account and see how it works, all the emails, before he hands out the list of emails
- rethink the welcome email that gets sent when they sign up for the site, add links? can it be formatted?
	- make comments on the lesson chats with it also
	- try to get 3 users to do the comments so its not just one
- add titles of lessons to the course chats and come up with a converstion starter (two needed)
- check on all of the course chats, does he still want them? or should we puch people towards the groups? ->> keeping both the course chats and the groups, put comments in both
- are the emails all set?  up to the first 4, might need to go over the intro email again



-Change the chat titles to share your thoughts on lesson __
-Make a link to 4 element yoga on the sites wherever it is mentioned


buy a chromebook for the trip
Make comments on the group and course chats
