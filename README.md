Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- yearly 
	
	
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now

See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

scorecard link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507

- he wants 10 questions per quiz if possible:
	- Quizzes that have 10 questions: # 1,
	- Quizzes than need 10 questions: # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5,
	- Quizzes than need a lesson to be dropped first: # 6, and up 

- google doc for emails:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc_WVsgZKdhpWaHZyDn81rw4y02Dlj2wB-O-q9ZnJXs/edit?usp=sharing

to do now:

- Write a review in fourissimo club for the heel strike fixing plantar fasciitis
- Fix the title of the download pdf on fourissimo page

- check names of lessons on promo page when new youtube video is dropped

Things im waiting for from dr w:
- email  list for current clients, hopefully soon
- new video explaining the 30 day challenge - probably not until summer
- more lesson videos

TO do:

Plan is to include 30 day challenge on the first 4 news letters, then not on the others, b/c everyone who signs up for the first 30 days will definitely be doing it/ not be done with it

Send newsletters on monday at 10 am

For email google doc:
- list of quotes
- list of tips
- list of videos

In future:

- Send emails at 10 am on monday for newsletter
- think of how to switch emails to be about the app, it should be ready sometime soon hopefully, he doesn't have the code yet, just the video
- give people the option between the app and the scorecard site? -> have a line like "download our scorecard app here or get a copy of the scorecard here" -> on both the site and in the emails

5/4

- add titles of lessons to the course chats and come up with a converstion starter (two needed)
-Change the chat titles to share your thoughts on lesson __
- hide the lessons that don't have content yet
 
Scorecard group https://growingholistically.com/groups/?scorecard-chat/

- The scorecard inspired me to _____ and _____
- Like somebody doing the scorecard and leaving little comments

Great outdoors group

- the weather was so nice today, it made my time gardening better
- something about ideas for what to do outside other than swimming when it it really hot
- then an answer can be go for walks/ bike rides in the early morning, or after sunset when it is cooled, go for hikes in shaded areas
- ideas for outside activities when the weather is bad, like cold and damp

Nutrition group

- share a recipe? Not against the idea of outside recipes ie quinoa salad recipe


- Skeinific is definitely a person, make sure she is confirmed

How does facebook, twitter, youtube, instagram, tiktok, the site, patreon connect to each other
He is thinking of giving current patients a free appointment if they join the patreon, figure out how to word that in a good way -> he will figure that out

see if the wordpress update changed the constnat contact problem

do the book edit
Add an email list only sign up
Learning program will not be free anymore, only the first lesson, need to make lots of little changes to the site
30 day challenge is still free
Keep stuff on the patreon, but have links to it
how to organize the videos on patreon also?
fix the form so people get added to constnat contact -> talk to peepso support

Ask if he still wants quizzes on the site -> i think so 
anyone can join, but to get access to more they need to join patreon OR anyone can join but they need a code from patroen

see if i can connect the constnat contact form to the pepso form, they sit on top of each other now, they can only do one at a time -> contacted peepso support, currently the sign up for email doesn't go through



8/24
Research integration between patreon and learndash
See if they be attached between site and patreon, or if we need 2 copies
In info section of book, ad you can get the book as a reward if you join the patreon 
Make a new homepage using the concept he sent, using the slider plugin keep it as a temp homepage for now, no widgets, fullscreen
Have a link that says “not sure you are ready to join? Try our free 30 day challenge”
Put something about the 30 day challenge in one of the slider tabs
Think about site redesigns, he might want to get rid of widgets entirely
Master slider is on the site now and activated
Talk to constant contact about the email list join on the peepso sign up
peepso can't get the join email list here section on the sign up
If not, remove the email sign up from the join page
Add the email list to the are you sure page, to get the scorecard




removed teh sign up to email list from the join page
maybe there is a way to use the contact form to add the peepso signup and the email signup to work together
confirm that we are linking to the patreon from the site for the videos
