plugins im using on site:

- peepso
	- updated included installer, easy to add new plugins
	- autoupdates need to be enabled every time they are updated
	- auto updates only work for main peepso plugin, not the additional ones
- learndash 
- paid memberships pro
- real simple ssl 
- Forget About Shortcode button 
- aksimet
- total upkeep
- widget context 
- code snippets -> remove it if he wants the image there, remove it still?
- autoptimization (not css, messed it up really bad)
- w3 total cache
- layout grid block

speed test:

https://web.dev/measure/:
- resize images
- check image loading
- server response time

Notes:

- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
	- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
	- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
		- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
 	- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
- pages allowed to nonmembers:
	- promo
	- login
	- registration
	- scorecard
	- patients
	- documentary page
	- second promo page
	- community activity
		- does peepso change the pages numbers when new updates are made?
	- Need:
		- sale page for redirect from weekly topic?
	
- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
- capitalize the element names everywhere

- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
	- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
	- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
	- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
		- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added

To Do:

- ssl not working in safari, silk browsers
	- certificate using old ip address, needs to be deleted from that server and it will use inmotion 
	- waiting on passwords/ usernames etc. 
	- he is taking the lead on this
	- work around? remove growing from syracuse, get new one
- change default user image
	-https://www.peepso.com/documentation/assets-overrides-customizing-peepso-images/ 
	- explains how to do it, need to figure out the default images we want
- fix cellphone view of menus
- does he want articles in monthly course? or as articles? 
- emails every week? multiple times a week?
- excess pages deleted, check every month or so
- add cancel course early section to page and get prior month free
- stop users from accessing wordpress login/logout page
- write out directions for downloading googledoc
- add pdf of scorecard directions
- see if users who don't join in with email confirmation can automatically be deleted after a week



To Do:


- see if we can take away website ask from from comment section, leave name and email
- make them use paypal when checking out, shows up as credit card possible
- at payment, say you will not be charged again after 4 months, "this learning program ends in four months, and your monthly payments will stop after your fourth month"
- put down included with membership under courses, monthly and 4 month??





To Do:


- add easier logout to page (header?)



Next call:
- home page:
	- archive system for the home page articles -> i think making them posts would be the best bet
		- have not linked the articles yet b/c waiting on archive system

- the powerpoint course is really long, how should i separate it?
	- do you have the rights to the photos in it? -> they're good, 
	- intro slide 1 to 27 -> how to separate intro slides?
	- why slide 28 - 35?
	- chakras 36 - 44
	- definitely needs a voice over or to be reorganized if we want it on the site
	- try separating it into 2-3 courses, 


-using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- yellow image for philosophers corner
- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh

current call:
	
- archive settings good? categories, unlisting , should I attach the articles(posts) to the home page?

To Do:
- monthly topics are archived as a lesson in a course
	- they can be deleted after a while if he wants (only go back for 3 months)
	- he wants to reuse them each year (unlist them for next year)

- set categories to air, fire, water, earth
- check images that i put in bigstockphot for powerpoint
- make widget about the powerpoint course above score card widget on right watch  dr w's lecture on the four elements
	- make sure all the rightside menu links are correct
- figure out survey so people can figure out elements, find a plugin, add totals up so people can get the breakdown



For Next week:
- see what shows up in credit card statement when you buy stuff


Next call:

	list of survey options/questions
		- want all of the 80 questions in list? maybe it should be shorter -> put all 80 in
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> separate it out manually (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- maybe hubspot for wordpress plugin? it's free, other ones i've found are quite expensive
		- or maybe quiz and survey master, they have a free version, see what is best
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
	
	- put about 6-8 questions in quizzes most of the time
	- separate the course into sections (about 25 slides each), put it on google drive
	- make sure that non admins can't get into wp dashboard, (blocked by memberships app)
