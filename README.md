https://web.dev/measure/:

TO do in future:
	- Come up with a prompt for the chat page for all lessons, not too long
	- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
	- make quizzes for each lesson need to do lesson 2 and 3

Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- pages allowed to nonmembers:
		- promo
		- login
		- registration
		- scorecard
		- patients
		- documentary page
		- second promo page
		- community activity
		- join 30 day challenge page
			- does peepso change the pages numbers when new updates are made?
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
	- forward comment emails to him
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
		- yellow image for philosophers corner
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes chould continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- yearly scorecard ink: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IxK22ihszAVXQgxLD9di-MhoP3kERT8SlfXiGddOmhc/edit
	- check names of lessons on promo page when new youtube video is dropped
	- Monthly topics will be articles now, not a class
	- page redirect completely turned off, might be that way now for sure
	- four corners page is a draft now


Survey stuff:

	list of survey options/questions:
		- want all of the 80 questions in list? maybe it should be shorter -> put all 80 in
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> separate it out manually (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- maybe hubspot for wordpress plugin? it's free, other ones i've found are quite expensive
		- or maybe quiz and survey master, they have a free version, see what is best
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
		- wpforms pro does not work the way he wants
		- tryuquiz does not work
		- he is taking care of the quiz
	


to do now:

- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
- look at the alt text on the images -> avoid lawsuits, I think we're in the clear images are used for window dressing, check on free web tester
- check login attempts 


See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

- Can we have people sign up to get an email once a day and other people once a week, different groups, email lists, starting at different times, chronological order when they join, everyday, every week , have them choose that, through peepso or learndash, or through a mailing thing, maybe constant contact, see if at allows chronological emails when you sign up
- https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/automated-welcome-series/ 15 emails every 2 days, look at core vs plus
- We will email you every other day with a link to a quick minute on youtube
- Put an image of the score card in so they can see it, on this page include the short lists of activities, with one paragraph of how to use it

- Figure how to add him to google analytics5
- THINK ABOUT 4 corners page, is it necessary ? maybe remove pictures, put the topics in the monthly topics section?
- text for lessons maybe? side pages? from the promo page? 
--------------------------------------------------------

- need to set up email, constant contact account + plugin, needs to be bought

 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

still gettign emails for 4elifestyle

He got the final proof of his book to a printer!
Look into how to sell the file of his ebook + format the illustrations

scorecard link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507
He is making more changes to the scorecard


After finalizing scorecard :
- Put 31 days in the months not the first one on scorecard, heâ€™s going to put tips in
- Fill in the days of the week in the monthly calendar for the scorecard months
- Change it to date in column 3 row 1 for the monthly one
- put the months in the other tabs




- Add a section about checking back every so often to see if there are new lessons
- get confirmation on quiz for the 3rd lesson
- get confirmation on quiz for the 4th lesson
- get confirmation on quiz for the 5th lesson
- figure out how to sell his ebook on his site -> put a link in to do list
- go through the pages and delete the old/extra ones
- need to buy constant contact -> then set up the emails for the 30 day challenge

- need constant contact for that also


- Look at youtube urls, have some go to the channel, others go to quick minutes
- Fix spacing under youtube video, have same amount of space below as is on top now
- Look into how to format an ebook
- On promo page fix first button for 30 day challenge, not showing up under video  -> removed the css that makes it show up only on small screens, but its still not working correctly



- need final check for the score card
- see if he wants other changes to the profile page
