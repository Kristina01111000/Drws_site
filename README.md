Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't

See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this
