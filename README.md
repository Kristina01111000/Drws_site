Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't

See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

8/30
On patreon make the holistic learning program link hot in the pinned post
write an email for new users of the patreon to get that talks about the community
look at the emails to see what needs to change, link to patreon, and growing holistically
Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month

9/7:


go over the quick minute videos, try to get 15 done by thursday, there are 24 on youtube, don't know how many on patreon
videos done: 9

work on spreadsheet for videos

12/7

- Fix the footer image -> need a new footer image that is a lot bigger, the width should be as wide as my screen and the height should be as be as long as the footer is in cellphone view
- Can google analytics work for patreon pages, add it if it does work


12/28
- Look into more ways to market the patreon
- For the app: Soon 
	- Make a slide
	- put page under programs tab in header
	- Is the app only for people who pay? Probably only for those who join at $5 a month or more 
- For fourelementinstitute and syracuse natural healing the security plugin caused a lockout again, look into getting a new one

For next week:
See if PMP can show the start date of the users if they aren’t paying


Notes: 
When people join the patreon: their email gets added to constant contact and we will manually make them an account on GH



FOr next week:
- make lesson nine chat page
- make chats for the lessons that need them (6,7,8,9) -> write leading questions for discussion
- change text on the chat pages to be about the lesson
- the header and footer images need to be fixed so they don't look bad when they're small
- add titles of lessons to the course chats 
- Change the chat titles to share your thoughts on lesson __
- still need 3rd graph paragraphs for 40Q and 80Q, about yin and yang


4/11
See how the self assessment shows up on google analytics
See if we can track the self assessment views 

Try to figure out what we would ask Basit so that we can track it

-> get the free version of monster insights to track the button clicks -> added it, it still doesn't appear to show the 40Q

the 40 Q takes a long time to load on the kindle, the starburst button doesn't work on the kindle


do the AICSEO for next week

-> make a different button to make sure its not the image that is acusing the problem
added link test to quiz page: https://growingholistically.com/quiz/
clicked it 4 times, check tomorrow


tried campaign monitor, can only put audio in if i hardcode the email in HTML, i can do it should I ?
get a free html template and then edit it -> look at code pen
confirm if he likes the constant contact email format

it still isn't showing up in google analytics under events, i can see how many people look at the page on the pages tab
added test link to patreon to see if it is the file that is the issue

put the test html emal into campaign monitor -> the audio did not send
audio files do not paste into google emails

4/18
Set up an email’: DrWalsdorf@syracusenaturalhealing.com
Subject will be a message from doctor w
For email text: please press the audio button to hear a special message from Dr w
Make the email and send it to him to get feedback, try to send first on monday to him for feedback
Try constant contact, its better than campaign monitor
Get the audio file he sent on april 4th for the email for patients
Base the email off of the audio file
put the text of the audio file underneath the audio file
He’s going to send me an email to fix the url said in a video, easier to change it on the site
Change the url of the self-assessment page to the about40Qselfassessment
Try to track which file is being downloaded
