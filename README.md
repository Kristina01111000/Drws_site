Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
		- yellow image for philosophers corner
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- yearly scorecard link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IxK22ihszAVXQgxLD9di-MhoP3kERT8SlfXiGddOmhc/edit
	- Monthly topics will be articles now, not a class
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now


Survey stuff:

	list of survey options/questions:
		- he wants all of the 80 questions in list
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
		- wpforms pro does not work
		- hubspot for wordpress does not work
		- quiz and survey master does not work
		- tryuquiz does not work
		- he is taking care of the quiz 
	
See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

- https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/automated-welcome-series/ 15 emails every 2 days, look at core vs plus

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

scorecard link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507

- See how to see all member data from peepso at one time -> is it even possible? -> look under users, or under manage -> nope, can look at learn dash stuff though

- he wants 10 questions per quiz if possible:
	- Quizzes that have 10 questions: # 1,
	- Quizzes than need 10 questions: # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5,
	- Quizzes than need a lesson to be dropped first: # 6, and up 

- Ccholistic1! For constant contact hwalsdorf

- google doc for emails:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc_WVsgZKdhpWaHZyDn81rw4y02Dlj2wB-O-q9ZnJXs/edit?usp=sharing

to do now:

- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
- Write a review in fourissimo club for the heel strike fixing plantar fasciitis
- Fix the title of the download pdf on fourissimo page
- For groups get new pictures, add a scorecard picture for scorecard group, are we still going to use groups?
- Look into file upload plugin for fourissimo page -> new plugin from peepso
- rethink the welcome email that gets sent when they sign up for the site, add links? can it be formatted?
- Come up with a prompt for the chat page for all lessons, not too long
- Make a list of the people who aren’t verified, see if peepso will do it automatically

- add a page for reviews, just dont link to it anywhere
- check names of lessons on promo page when new youtube video is dropped

Things im waiting for from dr w:
- email  list for current clients, on hold 
- new video explaining the 30 day challenge - probably not until summer
- more lesson videos

- check if we need an api for stripe

TO do:
- See if i can get lines on about dr w page to go ¾ of the way across
- he is going to write a different description - he sent it, look at it to see if it is good

- What  sample chapter should we add to the book listing? Probably chapter 1? Should I take the same excerpt from 4e lifestyle? https://4elementlifestyle.com/dr-ws-book/ introduction, part of chapter one, also include the table of contents, make sure some of the pictures are in the sample, up to page 15 
new description for the book listing? The current one is the one from 4e lifestyle, take it from the back cover of the book


- see if contact page is easily accessible on the site
- Send emails at 10 am? for chain
- Make logo of the youtube channel green part bigger add white background 

- Maybe don’t say the days of the challenge, think about that, so that we don’t make people who haven't started it don't feel bad but also sounds good to people who have started it

- think of how to switch emails to be about the app, it should be done soon

- On four element metaphysics crop the bottom picture so there isn't a big white space on the page

- On bottom of monthly topics page link to old monthly topics

emails done: 

emails waiting for confirmation: all the rest

Emails that need a tip of the day:

Emails i need to make: All of them,  need a good final email, based on the intro email? what are the things we should focus on for that?


3/16
- tips of the day -> they are in my email and look good, put them in the emails once we know what the service we are going to use is

3/23
- Look at mailchimp and campaign monitor to see if they are better, look at mail poet -> does not have the series for cheap, see if we want to still use constant contact, check the audio for all of them, he still wants to send audio file in emails if possible

- try to figure out another service that does chains of emails,mail poet costs about the same
should we stay with constant contact and just not do the chain?

- email files aren't supported by email plugins
- i can put the audio in manually, but it won't show up right for some people, 
- constant contact doesn't allow me upload an audio file, most won't, people usually don't use audio files in emails

get an update on when the app will be done, is it actually soon? like in a couple months?

- figure out which email plugin to use, i think just keep using constant contact, its still the best, the other ones look like they have similar prices for the email chains, if they even have them
- figure out why peepso autoupdate isn't working
