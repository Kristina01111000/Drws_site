Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't

See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

scorecard link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507

- he wants 10 questions per quiz if possible:
	- Quizzes that have 10 questions: # 1
	- Quizzes than need 10 questions: # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5
 	- Quizzes that need to be made: # 6	
	- Quizzes than need a lesson to be dropped first: # 7 and up 

- google doc for emails:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc_WVsgZKdhpWaHZyDn81rw4y02Dlj2wB-O-q9ZnJXs/edit?usp=sharing

to do now:

- Write a review in fourissimo club for the heel strike fixing plantar fasciitis
- 
Things im waiting for from dr w:
- email  list for current clients, hopefully soon
- more lesson videos


In future:

- Send emails at 10 am on monday for newsletter


5/4

- add titles of lessons to the course chats 
-Change the chat titles to share your thoughts on lesson __

- Skeinific is definitely a person, make sure she is confirmed

How does facebook, twitter, youtube, instagram, tiktok, the site, patreon connect to each other

Add an email list only sign up
30 day challenge is still free
fix the form so people get added to constnat contact -> talk to peepso support


see if i can connect the constnat contact form to the pepso form, they sit on top of each other now, they can only do one at a time -> contacted peepso support, currently the sign up for email doesn't go through



8/24
Have a link that says “not sure you are ready to join? Try our free 30 day challenge”
Add the email list to the are you sure page, to get the scorecard


8/30
Look at the quick minutes and see how they are, see if he should look at any of them
On patreon make the holistic learning program link hot in the pinned post
Maybe make a start here collection for the documentary and the phone app explanation, think of other ways of approaching it
Link from the patreon posts to the quizzes on gh
Enable quizzes only to patrons somehow
fix the lessons so they link to the patreon site post, so the video isn’t on gh
We might redo the entire first page, which is better pushing 30 day challenge or the patreon
Site should be focused on getting people to patreon and focusing on the community part of it, think about what parts of the site to get rid of

Figure out a way to make the metadata tags on patreon link to the site
New page: Have a section of dr w’s patreon collections, use a drop down or url with blurb about the collection and a link to the patreon site put on header where holistic growth is currently
Make the site look like a nice social media site
Have a start here patreon collection that includes the documentary, the gh site, and the scorecard
write an email for new users of the patreon to get that talks about the community
look at the emails to see what needs to change, link to patreon, and growing holistically
Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month



- make sure to read everything for slang that he doesn't know he is using



9/7:

Think about how the 30 day challenge should be used going forward, where should we talk about it etc, in a collection ‘things you can do now working title’ phone apps and more, something like that, talk about it in the newsletter
For homepage add more hotlinks below the slider, if you are already a member click here to get to our patreon site collections

go over the quick minute videos, try to get 15 done by thursday, there are 24 on youtube, don't know how many on patreon
