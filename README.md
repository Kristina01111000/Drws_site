Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't
	- The 4 vs. fours
		- 4 for 4 element yoga
		- 4 for 4 element lifestyle
		- 4 for 4 element renewal system?
		- Four for four element self assessment
		- Four for Holistic four element course
		- Four for Four element doctor
  	- to change an edited image, after editing go the the page and replace it with another then switch back
   	- recheck that constant contact is connected to the site every month or so, just look at lists in backend
    	- constant contact makes people choose which list to join if there is going to be more than 1 that they are added to, so only add them to one
	- changing the footer not necessary
	- talk about popups again in 3 months
--------------------------------------------------------

- google doc for emails:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc_WVsgZKdhpWaHZyDn81rw4y02Dlj2wB-O-q9ZnJXs/edit?usp=sharing

For Emails:

	- Should focus on links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month
 	- set up the automated emails, only one per list
	- Have 2 email lists,everyone added to both have the wellness check send after one day, then after 2 weeks have the 30 day challenge send
		- With a link or copy of posts from social pilot 
	- Video would have a link
	- Text post could stand alone, or have the beginning (read more) and a link to the rest

	- The Recalibrating Your Balance App – Phone/PC/Mac compatible – earn redeemable points as you develop a good health-building, life-renewing routine – coming soon
	- Make a slide
