Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't
	- The 4 vs. fours
		- 4 for 4 element yoga
		- 4 for 4 element lifestyle
		- 4 for 4 element renewal system?

  	- to change an edited image, after editing go the the page and replace it with another then switch back
  	-  Automation for emails:	https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/email-digital-marketing/articles/KnowledgeBase/43904-Set-up-an-automated-marketing-journey-for-your-customers?lang=en_US 
   	- recheck that constant contact is connected to the site every month or so, just look at lists in backend
    	- constant contact makes people choose which list to join if there is going to be more than 1 that they are added to, so only add them to one
	- Intake forms is going to be on https://my.standardprocess.com/Systems-Survey

For Emails:

	- Send emails at 10 am on monday for newsletter
	- Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month
 	- set up the automated emails, only one per list
	- test out email automation
	- Have the email resend it after 3 days
	- Have 2 email lists,everyone added to both have the wellness check send after one day, then after 2 weeks have the 30 day challenge send
	- Send an email every other week with constant contact, so that people’s inboxes don’t get inundated 
	- With a link or copy of posts from social pilot 
	- Video would have a link
	- Text post could stand alone, or have the beginning (read more) and a link to the rest


When app is ready:

	- The Recalibrating Your Balance App – Phone/PC/Mac compatible – earn redeemable points as you develop a good health-building, life-renewing routine – coming soon
	- Make a slide
	-  put page under programs tab in header
 	- add it to patreon
  	- another site?

Go through the sign up process to make sure the text is good still
Check that https://growingholistically.com/discover-your-4-element-personhood-score/ is correctly linked everywhere

See if there is a default password for everybody, don’t think so 
Tell them to autosave password if they want to 
Make a page to link to quick minutes, yoga, magazine, holistic advice, so they can be in the menu on the homepage
Think about the best way to do this, don’t want to just link to patreon
Make a page that links to the youtube playlist for them all, private urls
One page for all like “other parts of the self renewal system” something like that
