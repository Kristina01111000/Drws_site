plugins im using on site:

- peepso
	- updated included installer, easy to add new plugins
	- autoupdates need to be enabled every time they are updated
	- auto updates only work for main peepso plugin, not the additional ones
- learndash 
- paid memberships pro
- real simple ssl 
- Forget About Shortcode button 
- aksimet
- total upkeep
- widget context 
- code snippets -> remove it if he wants the image there, remove it still?
- redirection -> removed it, not needed anymore

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest

https://web.dev/measure/:
- resize images
- check image loading
- server response time

Notes:

- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
	- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
	- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
		- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
 	- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting

To Do:

- ssl not working in safari, silk browsers
	- certificate using old ip address, needs to be deleted from that server and it will use inmotion 
	- waiting on passwords/ usernames etc. 
	- he is taking the lead on this
	- work around? remove growing from syracuse, get new one
- change default user image
	-https://www.peepso.com/documentation/assets-overrides-customizing-peepso-images/ 
	- explains how to do it, need to figure out the default images we want
- test email plugin -> 
	- automatic login emails are working
- fix cellphone view of menu
- does he want articles in monthly course? or as articles? 
- emails every week? multiple times a week?
- excess pages deleted, check every month or so
- add cancel course early section to page and get prior month free
- fine tune new button description
- get rid of credit card link on payment (or see if it forces paypal)
	- check it, get paid for what i put in
	- set itto one dollar just for giggles
- check to see if 'one topic' word can be removed from the lesson content, or change it to lesson
- stop users from accessing wordpress login/logout page
- check the comments on scorecard
- 
Still Check:

-  peepso  for email issue

Next Call:

- different picture of him for front page? - torso or body shot
- ssl update
- does he have the front page video 

- write out directions for downloading googledoc

Next call:

- clean up scorecard paragraphs on page
- add pdf of scorecard directions
- add join here at bottom of front page menu

- switched homepage, and logo link -> other pages added to not redirect? score card, documentary
	- I would add the documentary to the bottom of the page, not a link
- need to fix widgets for  old front page -> fight with widgt context they updated the widget page so now it doesn't work correctly
	- the update makes you update all the old widgets so they look different, doesn't allow widget context to work anymore 
	- will try deleting widget context to make them work again


- fix redirects so login page is added to it (and start redirect again)
- make changes to widgts and remove then readd widget context

widget plan:
figure out why pages menu items look bad
fix it
re add widget context
see if it works
if yes -> YAY
if not -> talk to dr w
