Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't

For Emails:

	- Send emails at 10 am on monday for newsletter
	- Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month



When app is ready:

	- The Recalibrating Your Balance App – Phone/PC/Mac compatible – earn redeemable points as you develop a good health-building, life-renewing routine – coming soon
	- Make a slide
	-  put page under programs tab in header
 	- add it to patreon
  	- another site?

 
- For fourelementinstitute and syracuse natural healing the security plugin caused a lockout again, look into getting a new one



Notes: 
When people join the patreon: their email gets added to constant contact and we will manually make them an account on GH

Make chats for lessons 6,7,8,9 on GH, look at the writing style of the other commetns first to match them
