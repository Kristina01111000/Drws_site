plugins im using on site:

- learndash 
- paid memberships pro
- real simple ssl 
- Forget About Shortcode button 
- aksimet

- autoptimization (not css, messed it up really bad) - not using it anymore
- w3 total cache - not anymore
- layout grid block
- wp-staging -> deactivate when not in use
- wp-forms -> contact page
- File Upload Types -> allows epub to be added to media library

speed test:

Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't

See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

8/30
On patreon make the holistic learning program link hot in the pinned post
write an email for new users of the patreon to get that talks about the community
look at the emails to see what needs to change, link to patreon, and growing holistically
Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month

9/7:

found where to edit the lorem ipsum.  its in the javascript file, made edits, need access to c panel to put the file on the site, got access go over that i can edit the other text tomorrow if i'm careful

go over the quick minute videos, try to get 15 done by thursday, there are 24 on youtube, don't know how many on patreon
videos done: 9

figure out why siteground security was causing issues with login or find a new security plugin for both sites


work on spreadsheet for videos

11/30
- do the googleslide for all of his videos

12/7

- On the quiz page emphasize joining growingholistically in the big box
- Fix the footer image -> need a new footer image that is a lot bigger, the width should be as wide as my screen and the height should be as be as long as the footer is in cellphone view


- make sure he understands quickstart, how it doesn't save lgoins, + isn't that great, thats why i never brought is up before, it exists, but its propbably better to just keep them seperate



- Can google analytics work for patreon pages, add it if it does work


12/28
- Look into more ways to market the patreon
- For the app:
	- Make a slide
	- After dr w on homepage
	- put page under programs tab in header
	- Is the app only for people who pay? Probably only for those who join at $5 a month or more 

- For fourelementinstitute and syracuse natural healing the security plugin caused a lockout again, look into getting a new one

check on the quiz page

1/11
- Add the 40qq page back to the homepage, and to the header, and the menu
- Make text changes to the 40 and 80 QQ when it gets back
- connect the get out app page to the rest of the site
- make a slide for the app with a link to the app page


- tell basit how to fix the graphs on the quiz pdfs done with 80 q and with 40Q comment -> first question ready
- for letter to basit:
  	- write the formulas
  	- write one for the 40Q and one for the 80Q
  	- figure out how to fix the third graph
	- drw is taking care of the third graph
on mnday email him about the pdfs and if im emailing basit or if he is
figure out how to word the third question better so they can understand
- need to figure out how they measure the yin/yang section
- also write out a formula for the 3rd graph, going from words to variables is probably hard for them b/c english is not their first language
- need him to explain what he wants for the third graph and how they should figure it out
- tell him that they need a formula, b/c doing math word problems in another language is probably a big part of the issue
- - he can't find his comments he wrote -> they weren't in the pdf that i put my comments in
 
  1/25
  Graph Formulas
Graph 1: The first graph is supposed to show the percentages of each element, with the percentages totaling to 100%. The formula for for each element percent is 100% *(the raw score for the element)/ EarthRawScore+WaterRawScore+AirRawScore+FireRawScore] so for this graph the fire and water percentages would be 8.3% and the air and earth percentages would be 41.7%.
Graph 2: Is good the way it is
Graph 3. For the third graph, the inner circle should stay the way it is, with each element being 1/4th of the circle. The outer portion should follow this formula for the yin element percentage: 100% * YinElementRawScore / [EarthRawScore+WaterRawScore+AirRawScore+FireRawScore].The yang element percentage is the same formula: 100% * YangElementRawScore / [EarthRawScore+WaterRawScore+AirRawScore+FireRawScore].
Looks like graph three is wrong, he wants each element to add up to 100%, and each elelemtn should be in just its quarter of the graph

yin % = 100% * YinOfElement/RawElement
yang% = 100% * YangOfElement/RawElement


- Add the new lessons to the site with links
- Match the titles to the patreon


Lesson 6: This lesson will teach you about the metaphysics of the four elements, specifically the numerology of the elements and their effect on nature
Lesson 7: Learn about how spirituality, science, art, and the mundane parts of our lives relate to the four elements.
Lesson 8: Learn how the four elements have been integrated into an exciting new easy-to-learn yoga.
Lesson 9: Here is a more in-depth yoga sequence that focuses on each element and how they can help specific parts of your body.





For next week:
Make a quiz for lesson 9: what should you expect from your 4 element yoga, what body parts are affected by the elements, not about specific moves
Make a copy of the patreon picture + blurb and add it to the lessons on GH -> for lessons 6 -> 9
See if PMP can show the start date of the users if they aren’t paying
make chats for all of the quizzes 6 - 9, also write leading questions for discussion
he needs to update the peepso subscription soon, its slowing down the site -> significantly
remind him about my invoice + send january invoice


- the header and footer images need to be fixed so they don't look bad when they're small
- add titles of lessons to the course chats 
- Change the chat titles to share your thoughts on lesson __

ask aobut the lessons that are only available to the highest tier patrons
