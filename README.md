plugins im using on site:

- peepso
	- updated included installer, easy to add new plugins
	- autoupdates need to be enabled every time they are updated
	- auto updates only work for main peepso plugin, not the additional ones
- learndash 
- paid memberships pro
- real simple ssl 
- Forget About Shortcode button 
- aksimet
- total upkeep
- widget context 
- code snippets -> remove it if he wants the image there, remove it still?
- redirection -> removed it, not needed anymore

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest

https://web.dev/measure/:
- resize images
- check image loading
- server response time

Notes:

- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
	- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
	- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
		- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
 	- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting

To Do:

- ssl not working in safari, silk browsers
	- certificate using old ip address, needs to be deleted from that server and it will use inmotion 
	- waiting on passwords/ usernames etc. 
	- he is taking the lead on this
	- work around? remove growing from syracuse, get new one
- change default user image
	-https://www.peepso.com/documentation/assets-overrides-customizing-peepso-images/ 
	- explains how to do it, need to figure out the default images we want
- test email plugin -> 
	- automatic login emails are working
- fix cellphone view of menu
- does he want articles in monthly course? or as articles? 
- emails every week? multiple times a week?
- excess pages deleted, check every month or so
- add cancel course early section to page and get prior month free
- fine tune new button description
- get rid of credit card link on payment (or see if it forces paypal)
	- check it, get paid for what i put in
	- set itto one dollar just for giggles
- look at on a different computer, the google docs file won't let him copy
- remove email from scorecard comments
- change text color of the make a copy of the yearly scorecard
- check make a copy of google doc, he is getting only a view only
- make the a column stay on the left
- add monthly total for all 4 elements 
- add weekly totals for each week
- check to see if 'one topic' word can be removed from the lesson content, or change it to lesson


Still Check:

-  peepso  for email issue

Next Call:

- ssl update
- does he have the front page video
