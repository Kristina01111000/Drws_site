https://web.dev/measure/:

TO do in future:
	- Come up with a prompt for the chat page for all lessons, not too long
	- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
	- make quizzes for each lesson need to do lesson 2 and 3

Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- pages allowed to nonmembers:
		- promo
		- login
		- registration
		- scorecard
		- patients
		- documentary page
		- second promo page
		- community activity
		- join 30 day challenge page
			- does peepso change the pages numbers when new updates are made?
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
	- forward comment emails to him
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
		- yellow image for philosophers corner
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes chould continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- yearly scorecard ink: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IxK22ihszAVXQgxLD9di-MhoP3kERT8SlfXiGddOmhc/edit
	- check names of lessons on promo page when new youtube video is dropped
	- Monthly topics will be articles now, not a class
	- page redirect completely turned off, might be that way now for sure
	- four corners page is a draft now


Survey stuff:

	list of survey options/questions:
		- want all of the 80 questions in list? maybe it should be shorter -> put all 80 in
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> separate it out manually (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- maybe hubspot for wordpress plugin? it's free, other ones i've found are quite expensive
		- or maybe quiz and survey master, they have a free version, see what is best
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
		- wpforms pro does not work the way he wants
		- tryuquiz does not work
		- he is taking care of the quiz
	


to do now:

- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
- look at the alt text on the images -> avoid lawsuits, I think we're in the clear images are used for window dressing, check on free web tester
- check login attempts 


See if there is a way to see how many people downloaded the scorecard, use google for site analytics - he needs a google workspace account for this

- Can we have people sign up to get an email once a day and other people once a week, different groups, email lists, starting at different times, chronological order when they join, everyday, every week , have them choose that, through peepso or learndash, or through a mailing thing, maybe constant contact, see if at allows chronological emails when you sign up
- https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/automated-welcome-series/ 15 emails every 2 days, look at core vs plus
- We will email you every other day with a link to a quick minute on youtube

--------------------------------------------------------
 analytics add him as an admin for other sites -> check

scorecard link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boqAM_8NBEV09Uq_KDDhTZ4vUAS0WwAquNfRpROXE64/edit#gid=1517792507
He is making more changes to the scorecard


- go through the pages and delete the old/extra ones


Feedback from client

- See how to see all member data from peepso at one time -> is it even possible? -> look under users, or under manage -> nope, can look at learn dash stuff though
- Will be emailed other questions for quizzes from ben

- he wants 10 questions per quiz
	- quizzes that have 10 questions: # 1,
	- Quizzes than need 10 questions: # 2, # 3, # 4, # 5,
	- Quizzes than need a lesson to be dropped first: # 6, and up 

- he is having an issue with the link to the scorecard on membership signup page -> chrome and safari only, he needs to clear cookies, maybe turn off sitegroudn? clearing cookies didn't work, try to fix the issue one more time, then try peepso, didn't work for me in chrome, started  aa ticket with peepso
still waiting on them, update him, didn't have a pmp shortcode on the registration page

- Ccholistic1! For constant contact hwalsdorf@earth
- Get the constant contact stuff set up

- Add matching questions to other quizzes for 1 point only, thats what he wants it to be
- google doc for emails:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nc_WVsgZKdhpWaHZyDn81rw4y02Dlj2wB-O-q9ZnJXs/edit?usp=sharing
- Look into putting an essay attachment lesson for fourissimo club -> new plugin from peepso
- Try get to 10 questions for each quiz, if i can’t he will get it started, prompt him to go through them after they are up, ben might send some potential questions, but dont wait for them

For next meeting:

- Write a review in fourissimo club for the heel strike fixing plantar fasciitis
- Fix the title of the download on fourissimo page, tell him how to fix it -> what?
- For groups get new pictures, add a scorecard picture for scorecard group
- For google doc see if ‘make a copy’ can be put up when they try to request access
- Look into file upload plugin for fourissimo page -> new plugin from peepso
- If he gets a tiktok add it to the emails
- Set up a different campaign in cc for his current patients in office -> waiting on list from him
	- get feedback on the template
- need him to finalize the emails in the email chain 

Put the links in the 30 day email, right now just ***'s

still getting emails from 4elifestlye


look at to do list
- he is considering just using an email for his patients
- send october invoice

- think about video for youtube homepage, 30 day challenge adjacent
