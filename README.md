Currently working on Dr. W's site

		- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
- he uses inmotion web hosting
	- auto updates work now
		- not peepso or any of the its plugins
			- need to check it for updates every few days, it updates often
		- learndash is not auto updating 
			- enabled it, see if it works
		- or wordpress itself -> probably want to keep it this way

	- did not go out, need to check whats up
	- figure out how to force send one, peepso confirmation email works
	- error shows up in the site health status page, still not working
	- will need to contact peepso support
	- maybe set learndash email system instead?
		- on opening of new section and update to weekly topics?
	- talk it over with dr w

From Dr. W:

do you like the way the tiles look? I'm not sure if they mesh well with the front page, but I think they look good everywhere else

    I agree

do you like the new frontpage sidebar?

    Not really; I think it might be overkill for just quick navs to text on the page. Any thoughts?
    Might they look better on the left side, perhaps starting at the level of the italic text below our green name text?
     

 what about the login button, leave it, remove it, move it?

    Yes, its there on the top of the sidebar already.
    it looks weird where it is, I think it should be removed

do you like the button background?

    Are you talking about the call to action of joining? If so: The yellow tile background is ok. Is there a way to make the shape more interesting – perhaps a starburst?



Do you like the added text in the about the course section in the front page talking about the cost?

    I think it’s appropriate to have something in some of those yellow Call to action links that speak to the price of it. We should have different ways to say it, like Invest in yourself….

The green hot links work for me

How does the membership plug into the registration? Is there a discount code that a patient could have to allow them to use the existent registration form, or should we have a different page that they could be linked to from an email from me?
