plugins im using on site:

- peepso
	- updated included installer, easy to add new plugins
	- autoupdates need to be enabled every time they are updated
	- auto updates only work for main peepso plugin, not the additional ones
	- license code only works for a year, check every january 22
- learndash 
- paid memberships pro
- real simple ssl 
- Forget About Shortcode button 
- aksimet
- total upkeep
- widget context 
- code snippets -> remove it if he wants the image there, remove it still?
- autoptimization (not css, messed it up really bad)
- w3 total cache
- layout grid block

TO do in future:
	- Come up with a prompt for the chat page for all lessons, not too long
	- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
	- make quizzes for each lesson 

Notes:

- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
	- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
	- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
		- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
 	- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
- pages allowed to nonmembers:
	- promo
	- login
	- registration
	- scorecard
	- patients
	- documentary page
	- second promo page
	- community activity
		- does peepso change the pages numbers when new updates are made?

	
- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
- capitalize the element names everywhere

- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
	- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
	- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
	- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
		- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added


-using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- yellow image for philosophers corner
- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
To Do:

- ssl not working in apple browsers, old computers
- change default user image
	-https://www.peepso.com/documentation/assets-overrides-customizing-peepso-images/ 
	- explains how to do it, need to figure out the default images we want
- emails every week? multiple times a week?
- add cancel course early section to page and get prior month free
- see if users who don't join in with email confirmation can automatically be deleted after a week



To Do:


- see if we can take away website ask from from comment section, leave name and email
- make them use paypal when checking out, shows up as credit card possible
- at payment, say you will not be charged again after 4 months, "this learning program ends in four months, and your monthly payments will stop after your fourth month"
- put down included with membership under courses, monthly and 4 month??



To Do:
- monthly topics are archived as a lesson in a course
	- they can be deleted after a while if he wants (only go back for 3 months)
	- he wants to reuse them each year (unlist them for next year)
- set categories to air, fire, water, earth
- see what shows up in credit card statement when you buy stuff

Survey stuff:

	list of survey options/questions:
		- want all of the 80 questions in list? maybe it should be shorter -> put all 80 in
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> separate it out manually (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- maybe hubspot for wordpress plugin? it's free, other ones i've found are quite expensive
		- or maybe quiz and survey master, they have a free version, see what is best
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
	- put about 6-8 questions in quizzes most of the time

to do in future:
- Make quizzes for the 4 month course after lessons are added
- For articles always have picture wrapped by text
- update plugin list
- remind him about the ein until he gets it

to do now:
- get m to try out the site with the passcode
- make a staff account, remove administrator account if needed
- Check on other account how the course content that we don’t have access to yet looks
- module ->  lesson, 4 -> four (for elements, not month)
- check text color settings, he wants "say what you think" to be a different color


Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything

- opened ticket with peepso to see about hiding member on members page
	- it worked the whole time, administrators just see everything.  Non administrators don't see it if hidden

- send invoice next wednesday (9th)




- ask about lesson chats, still want them? if yes we should have a master list of chats that people can go to to chat, won't be able to block them out to just people who have taken that lesson already
- Color issue in forms, text boxes are too similar to background color, to pale green, or creamy color
- Think about colors to see if it can look less old fashioned, think about modern colors
- Switch the video in course to growing holistically channel




- Show my mom the video, ask a few other people about it
- Make a quiz for nerves, muscles,blood, bones  ~ 10 questions, may delete some
- Make administrator get alerted when people make comments -> admin dr w account
- Change leave a reply to leave a comment on the module chat page -> if i can’t change it then turn it to white
- Make master list of course chats, put at bottom of course paragraph
- Look for image line break flourish for promo page
	- Think about the line breaks
- Switch the promo page left menus to 1, with 4-5 links
- make sure the login widget is showing in mobile view
- make sure the widgets are right in mobile view
- figure out menu on mobile issue -> login and see how it goes
