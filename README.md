From Dr. W:

How does the membership plug into the registration? Is there a discount code that a patient could have to allow them to use the existent registration form, or should we have a different page that they could be linked to from an email from me?

Meeting today:

     - contact from inmotion? on ssl? SENT FILES TO INMOTION
     - 1099 form for payment? 16 hours this month, once a month not weekly NEXT WEEK

     - pmp doesn't allow different registration pages
     	- so patients page will still have payment option
	- and paid page will still have free option
	- figure something out with emails or get a different membership plugin?
	- FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY OTHER THAN EMAILS FOR PATIENTS
     - did payment work?

	-ADD CURRENT PATIENTS GROUP FOR PEEPSO IN PMP DR.W'S PATIENTS
