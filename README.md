Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- **make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout**
		- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- using pixlr for basic photo edits
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes should continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	- Monthly topics are articles now
	- page redirect completely turned off
	- four corners page is a draft now
 	- constant contact test email have the email of the account owner at the bottom, the actual emails don't

Should focus on things added to the patreon, links and description, recipe?, seasonal blurb, makes sense to send it once a month

try the hack and see if it works -. so far it did not -> it worked, but the audio still does not work :(
i don't think i can get the adudio to work the way he wants

- write leading questions for discussion (6,7,8,9), what did you think about the lesson, come up with more
- change text on the chat pages to be about the lesson (6,7,8)
- the header and footer images need to be fixed so they don't look bad when they're small

5/2
- Make rewrites for the homepage for the Four Element Self-Renewal System

- Add patreon link to the 30 day challenge
- Try cleaning the 30 day challenge up

- Double check all of patreon links 
- Add links to the patreon on the four element institute
- Get a different picture for the youtube channel profile picture
- send comments back on the emial he sent me for audio
- edit the css so that the video is full screen in small screens -> figure out why it is so small in cellphone view, it should go across the screen

- Speaking to David the Publicist who looked at our GH site on his phone, he just got a play button for the video - no image of me. so check the thumbnail
- Also he believes that for cell phone version we should not have a carousel, but instead Actionable buttons/links to the carousel videos They might load the site to phones quicker too he suggests. -> seperate the view into desktop and cellphone?, look into it, it might make the site look messy, we could have a group of links? like the slides but not slides, just textboxes in columns ?
go over the homepage changes
