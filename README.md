 Hours worked this month: 6
plugins im using on dr ws site:

- peepso
	- removed video plugin (it had malware in it)

Currently working on Dr. W's site

- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
	- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
	- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
		- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
- he uses inmotion web hosting
	- auto updates work now
		- not peepso or any of the its plugins
			- need to check it for updates every few days, it updates often
		- learndash is not auto updating 
			- enabled it, see if it works
		- or wordpress itself -> probably want to keep it this way 
- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
 	- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting

To Do:

	- explains how to do it, need to figure out the default images we want
- test email plugin -> set it to go out @ 4 today, 
	- did not go out, need to check whats up
	- figure out how to force send one, peepso confirmation email works
	- error shows up in the site health status page, still not working
	- will need to contact peepso support
	- maybe set learndash email system instead?
		- on opening of new section and update to weekly topics?
	- talk it over with dr w
	- automatic one for sign up works
- figure out how to get patients into it using pmp -> main focus
	- see if there is a link system or something else

From Dr. W:
     




The green hot links work for me

How does the membership plug into the registration? Is there a discount code that a patient could have to allow them to use the existent registration form, or should we have a different page that they could be linked to from an email from me?
