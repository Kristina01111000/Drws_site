plugins im using on site:

- peepso
	- updated included installer, easy to add new plugins
	- autoupdates need to be enabled every time they are updated
	- auto updates only work for main peepso plugin, not the additional ones
	- license code only works for a year, check every january 22
- learndash 
- paid memberships pro
- real simple ssl 
- Forget About Shortcode button 
- aksimet
- total upkeep
- widget context 
- code snippets -> remove it if he wants the image there, remove it still?
- autoptimization (not css, messed it up really bad)

TO do in future:
	- Come up with a prompt for the chat page for all lessons, not too long
	- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people
	- make quizzes for each lesson 

Notes:

	- with gecko theme in editor main background photo is set in theme -> body settings
		- need to put separate background pictures into additional css
		- figure out how to make pictures scroll -> change to scroll
			- normal pictures can just be put in using image in page builder
	- in peepso logo height has to be in px, not %
	- non-members cannot get access to courses, can view the headings 
		- fixed it in learndash settings, still can't figure out peepso setting
	- pages allowed to nonmembers:
		- promo
		- login
		- registration
		- scorecard
		- patients
		- documentary page
		- second promo page
		- community activity
			- does peepso change the pages numbers when new updates are made?
	- make sure to use peepso login and log out, not pmp login and logout
	- forward comment emails to him
	- all youtube videos need to be on the matching youtube page
	- .customclass is the class name to add a border around a group
	- capitalize the element names everywhere
	- wants some posts that visible always, some that are unlisted that he uses other sources
		- meta tags: don'treuse, taken from another source, copied, drwwritten, 
		- put in categories instead, unlist the ones from other sources, put them in unlisted category
		- all posts should have comments turned off -> for now
			- comments need to be removed manually if they are turned off after comments have been added
	-using pixlr for basic photo edits
		- yellow image for philosophers corner
	- used photo editor for flavenoids picture, font = fresh
	- for admin email change "Settings"=>"General"=>"E-Mail Address". set to mine now, hopefully he fixes the other sites email address thing
	- nothing on site can be hidden from administrators
	- current font sizes chould continue on through the site
	- Manager of youtube now also -> can change/add etc videos and everything
	
To Do:

- ssl not working in apple browsers, old computers
- change default user image
	-https://www.peepso.com/documentation/assets-overrides-customizing-peepso-images/ 
	- explains how to do it, need to figure out the default images we want
- emails every week? multiple times a week?
- add cancel course early section to page and get prior month free
- see if users who don't join in with email confirmation can automatically be deleted after a week



To Do:

- make them use paypal when checking out, shows up as credit card possible
- at payment, say you will not be charged again after 4 months, "this learning program ends in four months, and your monthly payments will stop after your fourth month"



To Do:
- monthly topics are archived as a lesson in a course
	- they can be deleted after a while if he wants (only go back for 3 months)
	- he wants to reuse them each year (unlist them for next year)
- set categories to air, fire, water, earth
- see what shows up in credit card statement when you buy stuff

Survey stuff:

	list of survey options/questions:
		- want all of the 80 questions in list? maybe it should be shorter -> put all 80 in
		- do you have a list of the q's separated into element groups? no-> separate it out manually (goes fire air water earth in the survey list)
		- maybe hubspot for wordpress plugin? it's free, other ones i've found are quite expensive
		- or maybe quiz and survey master, they have a free version, see what is best
		- i will be trying the quiz option for a learndash class first, might not work b/c they are not graded, they are split into categories
	--------- rank list 1 to 5 for each question
		- likert scale for questions in survey
	- put about 6-8 questions in quizzes most of the time

to do in future:
- Make quizzes for the 4 month course after lessons are added
- For articles always have picture wrapped by text
- update plugin list

to do now:

- check text color settings, he wants "say what you think" to be a different color
- Color issue in forms, text boxes are too similar to background color, to pale green, or creamy color
- hide lessons so they can't be seen by users until available?

- Show my mom the video, ask a few other people about it, have them make comments?
- Make chats for other people that sound good, 2 to 3 people

Figure out why rounded class didnâ€™t work on promo page pictures -> only on promo page

- check that contact page works -> it gets sent to administrator email, image + frowarded email to him
- ein done? nope
- also ssl fixed? for me yes, checking for him
- look on pages every so often, wrong link on the personal page
- make lesson 2 quiz
- add ghstaff llink to contact form -> links to page, have it start a chat instead?



- look for likert scale plugins, he wants it for site, get prices, try to get singular likert scale plugin, not a grouping of it and other stuff
- probably wp forms pro is best -> least baggage, most likely to work well
- about 200 dollars
- not sure if the results can be published to the user, talk to the people about it

Likert scale best option: wp forms pro, i'm not sure if you can publish the results to the user though, I am emailed tech support for the plugin about it and am waiting on the response
